Review the code for:

üîß **TYPE SAFETY & STRICTNESS**
- Usage of 'any' type that should be more specific
- Missing type annotations where inference isn't clear
- Implicit any in function parameters
- Missing return type annotations for complex functions
- Type assertions that could be unsafe
- Non-null assertions (!.) that might be risky

üìã **INTERFACE & TYPE DEFINITIONS**
- Inconsistent use of interface vs type
- Missing readonly modifiers for immutable data
- Optional properties that should be required (or vice versa)
- Types that could be more precise with literal types
- Missing index signatures for dynamic objects
- Improper use of extending interfaces

üîÑ **GENERIC TYPES**
- Missing generic constraints where needed
- Overly complex generics that hurt readability
- Generic types that could be inferred
- Missing generic utility types (Pick, Omit, etc.)
- Variance issues with generic types
- Bounded polymorphism opportunities

üõ°Ô∏è **TYPE GUARDS & ASSERTIONS**
- Missing type guards for runtime checks
- Unsafe type assertions without validation
- Type predicates that could narrow types better
- Missing discriminated unions for variant data
- Runtime validation that doesn't match types

‚ö° **ADVANCED TYPESCRIPT**
- Conditional types that could simplify logic
- Mapped types for transformations
- Template literal types for string manipulation
- Module augmentation opportunities
- Missing ambient type declarations

üîç **ERROR HANDLING & VALIDATION**
- Error types that could be more specific
- Missing Result/Either patterns for error handling
- Exception types not properly typed
- Missing validation at type boundaries
- Runtime/compile-time type mismatches

üì¶ **IMPORTS & MODULES**
- Missing type-only imports (import type)
- Circular dependencies between types
- Types exported that should be internal
- Missing re-exports from index files
- Module resolution issues

üéØ **REACT TYPESCRIPT (if applicable)**
- Missing proper prop types
- Event handler types that could be more specific
- Ref types that could be better typed
- Children prop typing issues
- Hook return types that need annotation

For each TypeScript issue found:
1. Explain why the current typing is problematic
2. Show the improved type definition
3. Explain how it improves type safety or developer experience
4. Consider compatibility with existing code
5. Suggest gradual improvement paths when relevant

IMPORTANT: When suggesting TypeScript fixes, provide confidence levels:
- **High Confidence**: Safe changes that clearly improve type safety
- **Medium Confidence**: Changes that likely improve code but may need testing
- **Low Confidence**: Suggestions that need careful review before applying

Only suggest fixes you have HIGH CONFIDENCE in. For others, explain the considerations needed.

If the TypeScript usage is excellent, highlight the good practices being followed.

Focus on actionable TypeScript improvements that enhance type safety, developer experience, and code maintainability.`
